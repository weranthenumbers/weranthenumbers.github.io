Hello All, <br />
<br />
We looked up our health care costs and how our health care ranks according to world health care ranking websites.  <br /> </p>
<img src="Media/percentage_of_gp_spent_on_healthcare.png" width="50%" align="center" /><br />
<p align="left">
Americans spend the most in the world, yet we rank 37th. France's health care system ranks first in the world and costs less than half of what we spend per person.  <br /> </p>
<p align="left">
We will pool our money together and buy universal health care. We have a bank account at Bank of America for money to be deposited. With jars all over this great nation we will collect money to buy universal health care. Attached are a poster for your window and label to print and put on your jar that says "I support universal health care". Check out our website to see our research and track the progress. The jars can be in your home or business. With your help we will have health care for everyone, for less money. <br />
<br />
Love, <br />
<br />
America
